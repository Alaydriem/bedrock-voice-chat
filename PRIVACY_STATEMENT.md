## Introduction

Bedrock Voice Chat is a voice chat application designed for use with Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The app connects you to voice chat servers that are independently hosted and operated by third parties ("Server Operators").

This policy explains what data we, Alaydriem ("Developer," "we," "us," or "our"), collect through the app.

**Key Point:** We do not operate any voice chat servers. We do not have any relationship with, control over, or responsibility for Server Operators or their data practices.

## Data We Collect

**We do not collect any personal data.**

The app functions solely as a client that connects you to third-party servers. We do not receive, store, or process:

- Your voice or audio
- Your IP address
- Your username or account information
- Your messages or communications
- Analytics or usage data
- Crash reports

The app operates entirely on your device and communicates directly with the servers you choose to connect to.

## Data Collected by Server Operators

When you connect to a voice chat server, the Server Operator — not us — may collect data such as:

- Your IP address
- Voice and audio transmissions
- Your Xbox Gamertag and profile picture
- Connection logs and timestamps

The default server provided with Bedrock Voice Chat Server Operators may deploy may log certain information for diagnostic purposes, and uses this information only to relay voice and other data packets from your client to other clients connected to the same server, in your voice group, or in proximity to you in-game.

**We have no visibility into, control over, or responsibility for what Server Operators collect or how they use it.** Each server is independently operated, and we have no relationship with any Server Operator.

Before connecting to any server, we recommend:

- Only joining servers operated by people you trust
- Asking the Server Operator about their privacy practices and if they've made any changes to the server instance running on their platform
- Understanding that servers may be located in any country and subject to different laws

## Children's Privacy

Bedrock Voice Chat is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone, including children.

Because we do not operate voice chat servers, we cannot control whether Server Operators comply with child protection laws such as COPPA (U.S.), GDPR-K (EU), or similar regulations. Parents and guardians should evaluate whether a particular server is appropriate before allowing their child to connect.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal data to a Server Operator, please contact that Server Operator directly.

## Information for Users in the European Economic Area (GDPR)

If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland:

Since we do not collect or process any personal data, GDPR obligations regarding data collection do not apply to our operation of the app. We have no personal data to access, correct, delete, or port.

However, Server Operators may be data controllers with respect to information they collect when you connect. You should direct any GDPR-related requests (access, erasure, portability, etc.) to the relevant Server Operator.

---

## Information for California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a California resident:

We do not collect, sell, or share personal information as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Because we collect no data, there is no personal information for you to request access to or deletion of.

Server Operators may independently collect personal information when you connect to their servers. Contact the Server Operator directly regarding any CCPA rights.

---

## Third-Party Services

The app may contain links to external resources or require you to enter server addresses. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party servers, websites, or services.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy if our practices change (for example, if we add crash reporting or analytics in the future). We will update the "Last Updated" date and, where feasible, notify users through the app or app store listing.
